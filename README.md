# Chess-Engine-Development
This Repository contains the main scripts behind my Chess Engine Project. I worked with a team but all the master commits were through this account.

The project uses PieceManager.cs as its main file and references other engines in different scripts. The goal of this project is to make it open source and get more people to contribute scripts that run their engines so the machine learning based engines in the project will get a better training set.
